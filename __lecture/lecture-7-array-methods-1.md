# JavaScript Array methods P1

---

- Arrays have a bunch of methods attached to them.
- Many of which you'll use on a daily basis.

---

## Common Array methods

```js
// Example 7
const arrayOne = ["think", "dream", "learn", "write"];
const arrayTwo = ["thought", "dreams", "knowledge", "truth"];

let newArray = arrayOne.concat(arrayTwo);
```

---

```js
// Example 8
const lexicon = [
  "The",
  "large",
  "shaggy",
  "dog",
  "barked",
  "at",
  "the",
  "silence",
];

let sentence = lexicon.join();
```

And there are so many more.

## Group Exercise

<!-- Split class into breakout rooms of 2 people, and assign them each a pair of methods. -->

Let's dip into the internet and see if we can learn all of these methods collectively.

1. `.includes()`, `.slice()`
2. `.indexOf()`, `.push()`
3. `.pop()`, `.sort()`
4. `.shift()`, `.unshift()`
5. `.reverse()`, `.lastIndexOf()`
6. `.splice()`, `.toString()`

- find an explanation/definition, then write your own.
- create two examples of each method in use. Be creative. ðŸ˜›
